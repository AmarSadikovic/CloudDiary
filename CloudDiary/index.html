      <p>Welcome to Cloud Diary. This is a site where you can save your notes/thoughts securely without anyone ever finds out your secrets.</p>
      <p>The point of this website isnt really the aesthetics but the usage of php. Therefore I have focused on actually using as much php as possible.</p>
      <p>Sure, the visual of the website could be better. Overall the website is functional. <a href="login/index.html">Take me to login page.</a></p>
